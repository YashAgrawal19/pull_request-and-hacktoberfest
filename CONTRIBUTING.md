Contribution Flow

This is a outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

Create a separate branch from master branch to base your work.
Make commits of logical units.
Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
Make sure to proofread the content before submitting.
Submit a pull request to the original repository.
